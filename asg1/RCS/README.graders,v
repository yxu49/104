Instructions to graders:

Note that students may have submitted an earlier project
than the one explicitly mentioned in the due date.

1. Copy all files from the score directory into the student's
   submit directory.

2. Run mk.build

3. If mk.build succeeded, run mk.tests:

   (3a) Check to see what output files were created.
        * If only .str files were created, grade as asg1
        * If .str and .tok files were created, grade as asg2
        * If .str, .tok, .ast all created, grade as asg3
        * If .str, .tok, .ast, and .sym created, grade as asg4
        * If all 5 files, including .oil created, grade as asg5
        Use ONLY one of the SCORE.asg files to do the grading,
        as specified above.

   (3b) DELETE all SCORE files, except for the one describing
        the project that the student submitted.  Grade only
        one project, not several.

   (3c) Edit the appropriate SCORE.asg* file.

4. If mk.build failed, look at the code to see what modules
   are present and choose which project to grade as appropriate.

   (4a) DELETE all irrelevant SCORE.asg* files and edit the
        part for SOURCE CODE.

   (4b) Assign 0 for program execution since there is no 
        oc to run.

5. Make a SYMLINK, don't copy to create a SCORE symlink:
   e.g.  ln -s SCORE.asg1 SCORE
   or whatever SCORE.asg* file you just graded.

6. If pair programming, cd partner's directory and make two
   symlinks:
   ln -s ../PARTNER/SCORE .
   ln -s ../PARTNER/SCORE.asg? .
   (Substitute a number [1-5] for the ?
