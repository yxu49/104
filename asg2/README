3 Partner: Tian Qiu (tqiu1@ucsc.edu)
4 Partner: Yijiong Xu  (yxu49@ucsc.edu)

6 We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
7 drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
8 at most 25% of an individualâ€™s effort for an assignment should
9 be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
10 must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
11 together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
12 two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.
